            "content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://meshtastic.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Meshtastic</a> is an open-source project that facilitates encrypted off-grid text communication between individuals and groups using low-cost radios. </p>\n<p>I've played with it intermittently for a few years but recently have gotten more involved. Thanks to talented devs and a passionate user-base, the community has grown significantly and the project matured.</p>\n<p>I think it's a great way to learn about radio technologies, open-source projects and deploy a fairly inexpensive backup communication system across communities.</p>\n\n<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>\n<p>Meshtastic is a software project creating firmware that can be installed on off-the-shelf <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LoRa </a>radios and apps to interface with the radios. These radios are inexpensive, easily programmed and readily available online. Conveniently, since LoRa is within the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_radio_band\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ISM Bands</a>, no license is required (at least in the US). </p>\n<p>Once the firmware is installed, two radios can communicate with each other using the public channel or private encrypted channels. However, the \"Mesh\" part of the name is where things get interesting. Each radio also acts as a repeater, relaying messages that it receives (even if it can't decrypt them). These messages typically have a hop limit of three and upon relaying a signal, the radio will decrement the hop counter by one. This allows a distributed group of unaffiliated users to potentially cover a city with a relatively small amount of devices. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://n7kjl.net/media/posts/4/gallery/Meshtastic-diagram.png\" data-size=\"988x711\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://n7kjl.net/media/posts/4/gallery/Meshtastic-diagram-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"553\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>As with everything in radio, the height and quality of your antenna is what primarily dictates range. The LoRa radios transmit with less than 1 watt, however the <a href=\"https://meshtastic.org/docs/overview/range-tests/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">current range record</a> between two Meshtastic devices is 254km! Of course, there are many additional factors that come into play and realistically you can expect a few kilometers. </p>\n<h2>Use Cases</h2>\n<p>As with most open-source projects, people have different reasons for getting involved. The obvious use for Meshtastic is establishing an off-grid communications system between friends/family, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_emergency_response_team\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CERT</a> or groups operating in areas without infrastructure. In that capacity it can provide provide redundancy in the event that cell towers or satellites are unavailable. However the project is also an opportunity to learn about radio, 3D modeling/printing, software development, community organization and more. </p>\n<h2>...Speaking of Cases</h2>\n<p>The radios typically don't come with a case of any sort so users often times 3D print their own or buy printed cases from the community. I'm currently using cases I printed designed by <a href=\"https://www.printables.com/@TonyG/models\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TonyG, available on Printables</a> </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"5\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://n7kjl.net/media/posts/4/gallery/PXL_20240311_011450847.jpg\" data-size=\"3072x4080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://n7kjl.net/media/posts/4/gallery/PXL_20240311_011450847-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"RAK19007 in case by TonyG\" width=\"768\" height=\"1020\"></a>\n<figcaption>RAK19007 in case by TonyG</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://n7kjl.net/media/posts/4/gallery/PXL_20240217_031057976-2.jpg\" data-size=\"3072x4080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://n7kjl.net/media/posts/4/gallery/PXL_20240217_031057976-2-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"RAK19007 in case by TonyG\" width=\"768\" height=\"1020\"></a>\n<figcaption>RAK19007 in case by TonyG</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://n7kjl.net/media/posts/4/gallery/PXL_20240217_031307706-2.jpg\" data-size=\"3072x4080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://n7kjl.net/media/posts/4/gallery/PXL_20240217_031307706-2-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"RAK19007 internals\" width=\"768\" height=\"1020\"></a>\n<figcaption>RAK19007 internals</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://n7kjl.net/media/posts/4/gallery/PXL_20240217_031318111.jpg\" data-size=\"4080x3072\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://n7kjl.net/media/posts/4/gallery/PXL_20240217_031318111-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"RAK19007 internals\" width=\"768\" height=\"578\"></a>\n<figcaption>RAK19007 internals</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://n7kjl.net/media/posts/4/gallery/PXL_20240217_030831925-2.jpg\" data-size=\"4080x3072\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://n7kjl.net/media/posts/4/gallery/PXL_20240217_030831925-2-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"My original T-Beams\" width=\"768\" height=\"578\"></a>\n<figcaption>My original T-Beams</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"1\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://n7kjl.net/media/posts/4/gallery/RAK19007-Case-Printing.webp\" data-size=\"1280x720\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://n7kjl.net/media/posts/4/gallery/RAK19007-Case-Printing-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Printing a case, designed by TonyG (on my trusty, old, cheap, MP Mini Select)\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a>\n<figcaption>Printing a case, designed by TonyG (on my trusty, old, cheap, MP Mini Select)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<h2>Adoption and Community</h2>\n<p>As I mentioned, the community has grown significantly from when I first heard about it three years ago. Here in Portland Oregon there are over 100 active nodes, and there's an ongoing thread in the community's <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/ktMAKGBnBs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Discord server</a> specifically for Oregon. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"1\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://n7kjl.net/media/posts/4/gallery/meshtastic-map-2.png\" data-size=\"1092x656\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://n7kjl.net/media/posts/4/gallery/meshtastic-map-2-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"461\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Elsewhere on the Discord server, you'll find global conversations for support, enclosures and development. I've found everyone to be friendly and happy to help users get started or troubleshoot issues.</p>\n<h2>Recommended Hardware</h2>\n<p>There are a lot of radios to choose from, but they mostly break down into two main types as determined by their processor: </p>\n<p>ESP32</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">Cheap and readily available on Amazon</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">Tend to consume more power</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">Good for situations where they can be plugged in or recharged daily. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>nRF52</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In higher demand, so are sometimes out of stock</li>\n<li>Far more power efficient</li>\n<li>Better for solar-powered repeaters or mobile applications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'd recommend starting with the <a href=\"https://store.rokland.com/collections/rakwireless-products/products/rak-wireless-wisblock-meshtastic-starter-kit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Meshtastic Starter kit</a>, which includes a WisBlock Core RAK4631 and RAK19007 baseboard. When buying a radio, pay attention to the <a href=\"https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/frequencies-by-country/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">frequency corresponding to your country</a>. In the USA, we're on 915MHz. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://store.rokland.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rokland</a> is the official RAK distributer in the USA and has fast ship times however, they can sometimes have low inventory. Alternatively, you can buy from the <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.com/store/1101236139?spm=a2g0o.detail.0.0.21de329dyZqNDQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RAK store on AliExpress</a> though expect longer ship times. </p>\n<p>Regardless of what you pick up, you'll likely want to <a href=\"https://meshtastic.org/docs/hardware/antennas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">upgrade the antenna</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

I found myself constantly worrying about security vulnerabilities, updates and managing servers rather than working on projects and writing posts. </p>\n<p>In the end, I scrapped the sites and forgot about the whole thing, which brings us to today. There has been a resurgence of static websites and tools to build them, enough so to spark my interest and start this site. I'll recap my experiences so far and intend to keep posting as part of the experiment. </p>\n\n<h2>What Are Static Websites?</h2>\n<p>A static website is a site like any other, but it doesn't rely on databases or server-side scripting like PHP. As a result, it can not<strong> </strong>provide interactivity, comments, logins, etc. Instead, it merely serves up HTML and JavaScript hosted by any basic web server like Apache or NGINX. </p>\n<p>This is likely similar to how many of us started: creating an index.html file and opening it with Notepad. This approach still works of course, however it becomes difficult to manage as the site grows larger. Additionally you're missing out on useful features like tagging, prebuilt themes, WYSIWYG editors, etc. </p>\n<p>In order to bridge the gap between simplicity and functionality, there are numerous Content Management Systems (CMS) that you can install locally which help to build and structure a website. When you're ready to publish, it renders the content into static source files and uploads them to the server of your choice. </p>\n<p>Like any website, you have the option of loading external resources such as fonts and libraries. However, in an effort to simplify and secure these sites, many of the CMSs bundle all dependencies within the compiled files. </p>\n<h2>Are they worth it?</h2>\n<p>So if a static website is defined by what it can't do, why would you bother? I would argue that the benefits fall into three main categories:</p>\n<p><strong>Simplicity: </strong>In order to get started with a static website, all that is needed is a web server like Apache or NGINX. In order to setup your build environment, it's as simple as installing a local CMS. If you have multiple editors, they can sync files via Google Drive, DropBox, etc (I use a self-hosted Nextcloud instance). Source control can all be managed via the Git service of your choice. </p>\n<p><strong>Security: </strong>Since the pages lack any form of input and there is no server-side code to run, the attack surface is drastically reduced. There are no updates to manage and no third party libraries to be compromised. Additionally, the lack of server-side scripting or cookies makes GDPR compliance easy.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed: </strong>Without server-side code, DB lookups or third party dependencies to load, pages load significantly faster. That speed and reduced size translates to reduced costs and better user-engagement. </p>\n<h2>What I'm using</h2>\n<p>As I mentioned, there are many CMS tools to choose from, including <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\" title=\"Hugo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HUGO</a> and <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/\" title=\"Jekyll\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jekyll</a>. However, I landed on <a href=\"https://getpublii.com/\" title=\"Publii\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Publii</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://n7kjl.net/media/posts/3/gallery/publii-screenshot.png\" data-size=\"1194x683\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://n7kjl.net/media/posts/3/gallery/publii-screenshot-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"439\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Publii strike a wonderful balance between simplicity and functionality.

Instead, all files; fonts, scripts, icons, and CSS files, as well as any images Publii generates, are stored locally.<br><br>Basically, if you're running a base Publii website without any third-party extensions, then you're site should be fully GDPR compliant; no mess, no fear, no fuss.\"<br><a href=\"https://getpublii.com/privacy-focused/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://getpublii.com/privacy-focused/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You simply download the installer and connect to the hosting solution of your choice. In my case, I'm going to GitHub Pages and use Cloudflare for DNS/WAF/Analytics.</p>\n<p>So far, the simplicity of Publii was reason enough to get me interested in posting again. We'll see how it goes over the coming year. </p>\n<p> </p>",
